            <b>Linux</b>
            <i>(/ˈliːnʊks/ (listen) LEE-nuuks or /ˈlɪnʊks/ LIN-uuks)</i> is a family of open-source <ln handle="unixlike" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like">Unix-like</ln> operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by <ln handle="linus" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</ln>. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the <ln handle="gnu" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project">GNU Project</ln>. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name <i>"GNU/Linux"</i> to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.

            Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds: <b>to create a new free operating system kernel</b>. The resulting Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history. Since the initial release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from a small number of C files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 with more than 23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments, under the <i>GNU General Public License v2</i>.

        The <ln handle="unix" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</ln> operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969, at <ln handle="bells" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">AT&T's Bell Labs</ln>, in the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in <ln handle="assemb" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembl language</ln>, as was common practice at the time. In 1973, in a key pioneering approach, it was rewritten in the <ln handle="clang" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C programming language</ln> by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O routines). The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier.

        <p>
        A Linux distribution[a] (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel, and often a package management system. Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the <ln handle="distro" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">Linux distributions</ln>, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices (for example, OpenWrt) and personal computers (for example, Linux Mint) to powerful supercomputers (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution).
