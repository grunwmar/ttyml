 [1mLinux[0m [3m(/ˈliːnʊks/ (listen) LEE-nuuks or /ˈlɪnʊks/ LIN-uuks)[0m is a family of open-source [4;34mUnix-like>[0m [32m^unixlike[0m operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by [4;34mLinus Torvalds[0m [32m^linus[0m. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the [4;34mGNU Project[0m [32m^gnu[0m. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name [3m"GNU/Linux"[0m to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.

 Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds: [1mto create a new free operating system kernel[0m. The resulting Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history. Since the initial release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from a small number of C files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 with more than 23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments, under the [3mGNU General Public License v2[0m.

 The [4;34mUnix[0m [32m^unix[0m operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969, at [4;34mAT&amp;T's Bell Labs[0m [32m^bells[0m, in the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in [4;34massembl language[0m [32m^assemb[0m, as was common practice at the time. In 1973, in a key pioneering approach, it was rewritten in the [4;34mC programming language[0m [32m^clang[0m by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O routines). The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier.

 A Linux distribution[a] (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel, and often a package management system. Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the [4;34mLinux distributions[0m [32m^distro[0m, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices (for example, OpenWrt) and personal computers (for example, Linux Mint) to powerful supercomputers (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution).
